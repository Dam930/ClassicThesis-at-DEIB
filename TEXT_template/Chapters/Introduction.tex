Reinforcement Learning \ac{RL} is a field of machine learning that aims at building intelligent machines, called agent, capable of learning complex tasks from experience.
The goal of \acs{RL} \cite{sutton1998reinforcement} algorithm is to learn the best actions by direct interaction with the environment and evaluation of the performance in the form of a reward signal.
